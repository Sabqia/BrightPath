# BrightPath
This project is focused on understanding and improving student lifestyles, with the goal of helping them lead healthier, more balanced lives. It recognizes that students face many challenges, such as managing academic responsibilities, maintaining good mental and physical health, and navigating social pressures. The project aims to identify key areas where students can make positive changes to reduce stress, improve their well-being, and perform better academically.
By analyzing various factors such as sleep habits, physical activity, social interactions, and study routines, the project seeks to uncover how these elements influence stress levels and overall success. For example, getting enough sleep, engaging in regular physical exercise, and developing healthy social habits can reduce stress and improve focus and energy levels, leading to better grades and a more fulfilling life.
The ultimate goal of the project is to provide students with practical guidance on how to improve their daily routines and lifestyle choices. By encouraging students to balance their academic, social, and personal lives, they can develop better habits that support both their mental and physical health, leading to improved academic performance and long-term success.
